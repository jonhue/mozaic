## Installation

Mozaic works with Rails 5 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'mozaic'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mozaic

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'mozaic', github: 'jonhue/mozaic'
```

Now run the generator:

    $ rails g mozaic:install

---

## Usage

### Layouts

You can run a generator to create new layouts

    $ rails g mozaic:layout -n my/new/layout

**Note:** Pass the `-e` option to extend another layout with this new layout.

You can use the `mozaic` helper to extend other layouts:

```haml
= mozaic :layout do
    ...
```

`mozaic` takes the layout you want to extend as a first and the area where content should be rendered as a second parameter. Both of them default to `:mozaic`.

Here is how you specify areas to extend layouts:

```haml
= mozaic_area :area do
    ...
```

**Note:** Make sure that your area names are unique across all layouts.

### Components

Mozaic allows you to define components to organize your code:

    $ rails g mozaic:component -n name

```ruby
Mozaic.configure do |config|
    config.define_component :name
end
```

You are also able to pass default options to your components:

```ruby
Mozaic.configure do |config|
    config.define_component :name, lovely: true
end
```

```haml
= options[:lovely].to_s
```

You can run custom code whenever your component gets rendered:

```ruby
Mozaic.configure do |config|
    config.define_component :name, lovely: true do |options|
        options[:lovely] = !options[:lovely]
        options
    end
end
```

Return `false` in the block to return `nil` instead of rendering the component:

```ruby
Mozaic.configure do |config|
    config.define_component :name, lovely: true do |options|
        false unless options[:lovely] == true
    end
end
```

Components can also be defined in your ActiveRecord classes:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
    define_component :avatar
end
```

Rendering components is fairly straight forward:

```haml
= component :name
```

You are able to override the default options:

```haml
= component :name, lovely: false
```

And to pass a block:

```haml
= component :name, lovely: false do
    It is lovely.
```

Here is how to access a block in your component:

```haml
= options[:lovely].to_s
= block
```

### Assets

#### Webpack (ES6)

The component generator generates asset files in your [configured](#configuration) directories.

The JavaScript assets use ES6 by default. You can now import a component:

```javascript
import ComponentName from 'mozaic/component/name';
let componentName = new ComponentName(document.querySelector('.mozaic-component.document-name'));
```

#### Sprockets

With Mozaic you can automatically add assets to the asset pipeline by naming them like the component they belong to. Just require Mozaic in your application assets:

```javascript
//= require_tree ./mozaic
```
```css
/*
 *= require_tree ./mozaic
 */
```

For instance a component with the name `'my/test/component'` can have a javascript asset located at `app/assets/javascripts/mozaic/my/test/component.js` and a stylesheet under `app/assets/stylesheets/mozaic/my/test/component.css`.

**Note:** Asset files are being created automatically when using the component generator.

## Configuration

You can configure Mozaic by passing a block to `configure`. This can be done in `config/initializers/mozaic.rb`:

```ruby
Mozaic.configure do |config|
    config.define_component :name
end
```

* `define_component` Define components
* `es6` Whether generated JavaScript assets for components should use ES6 syntax or not. Accepts a boolean. Defaults to `true`.
* `javascripts` Directory to place JavaScript assets for components in. Accepts a string. Defaults to `'app/javascript/javascripts'`.
* `stylesheets` Directory to place styleshets for components in. Accepts a string. Defaults to `'app/javascript/stylesheets'`.
